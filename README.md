# Awesome Claude Code Agents

## SUPER QUICK UPDATE

I don't have time to maintain this (if you haven't noticed). I'm happy to use it as a "meta-list" for anyone who has their own Claude Code agents repository/list, but I don't have time to review submissions or anything - so, if you have a list (or a sizeable collection of your own agents), feel free to open a PR and I'll probably just leave this up as a way to share some links to other people's lists/projects who do have the time. God bless.

### Agent Frameworks

[`Code By Agents`](https://github.com/baryhuang/code-by-agents) by [Bary Huange](https://github.com/baryhuang)  
An orchestration framework for designing and coordinating Claude Code agents, with a very clean interface, and sophisticated orchestration logic. (I think this might possibly involve a hand-rolled agent framework, given the committerdates, so that's pretty amazing.)

[`awesome-claude-agents`](https://github.com/rahulvrane/awesome-claude-agents) by [Rahul Rane](https://github.com/rahulvrane)  
A _slightly_ similar repository ðŸ˜‰ to the present one with a growing list of awesome agents for Claude Code.

[`Claude Code Subagents Collection`](https://github.com/wshobson/agents?tab=re) by [Seth Hobson](https://github.com/wshobson).
A pretty impressive resource with _dozens_ of awesome-looking agents that I haven't even had time to explore yet, but clearly this gentleman has put a lot of work into this feature that's been out for one freaking day at the time of writing!

## Contributing

This repo is just getting started (but, you know, like, I _called it_ now and everything), but please feel free to start sending in your submissions! And please be sure to share (a) the prompt you used (if you had Claude's help); (b) the actual agent file; (c) something that you have built or done with the agent.

And, finally, if you're one of the people mentioned above, and you want to bear the heroic burden of maintaining an awesome-list, just reach out to me (a.k.a. Him) and I'm sure we can find a suitable venue for a code golf competition or something to decide who is truly the awesome. ðŸ˜œ Probably, by the time I finish writing this, there will be four to ten more repos like it, and I'm happy to just bask in the awesomeness of my own list.

Happy coding! (...wait, no one does that anymore...)

Have a great day!
